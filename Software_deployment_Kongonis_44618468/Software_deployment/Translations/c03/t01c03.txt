Not honoring those who are esteemable
Ensures that the citizens do not strive.
Not valuing rare goods
Ensures that the citizens do not act like thieves.
Not showing that which can be desired
Ensures that the citizens’ heart/minds do not become
confused.

Thus the governing of the sage
Empties their heart/minds, fills their stomachs,
Weakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.

By always ensuring that the citizens are
without-knowledge and without-desire,
Those who make men wise will not dare to act.
Act with non-action, then all will be governed!
