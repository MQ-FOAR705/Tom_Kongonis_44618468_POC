Not to quest for wealth
will keep the people from rivalry.
Not to prize things that are hard to come by
will keep the people from becoming thieves.
Not to manifest what you like and desire
will make popular sentiments undisturbed.

So, in the sages' peaceful and tranquil world,
People's state of mind is calm,
People live with enough food
People's aspirations are lowered,
People's physiques are strong;
People will be unknowing, undesiring,
And even the knowing ones will never dare to act,
Action without action.
