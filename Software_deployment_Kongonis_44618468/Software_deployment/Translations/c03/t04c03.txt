Do not honor the worthy. This will keep the people from contention. Do not
prize rare things. This will keep the people from becoming thieves. Do
not display the desirable. The hearts of the people will not be
turbulent.

Hence the governance of the sage:
Empty their minds and fill their bellies,
Weaken their wills and strengthen their bones.
Always render the people free of knowledge and desire. Ensure that the
clever do not dare to act.

Engage in non-action (wuwei) and nothing will go unruled.
