A dao that may be spoken is not the enduring Dao. A name that may be
named is not an enduring name.
No names – this is the beginning of heaven and earth. Having names – this is
the mother of the things of the world.

Make freedom from desire your constant norm; thereby you will see what is
subtle. Make having desires your constant norm; thereby you will see
what is manifest.

they may be termed ‘the mysterious’.
Mystery and more mystery: the gate of all that is subtle.
