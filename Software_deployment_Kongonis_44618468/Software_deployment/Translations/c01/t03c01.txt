The Dao [that] can be stated, is not the eternal Dao;
The name [that] can be named, is not the eternal name.
The nameless is the origin of heaven and earth;
The named is the mother of the myriad things.
So,
By constantly having no [desire] one views its wonders;
By constantly having [desire], one views its limits.
These two have the same origin, but they differ in name;
Both are called Mystery.
One Mystery plus another Mystery, is the source of all wonders.
