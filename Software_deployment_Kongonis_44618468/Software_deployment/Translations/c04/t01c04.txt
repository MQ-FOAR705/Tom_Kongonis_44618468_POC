Dao is like a cup or bowl, yet use it and there exists no
need to fill it.
Profound and deep!, it appears to be the ancestor of the ten
thousand creatures.

It blunts their sharpness,
Loosens their tangles,
Softens their brightness,
Makes them the same as the dust of the world.

Deep and profound!, it seems to barely exist.
I do not know whose child it is –
Its image came before that of god.
