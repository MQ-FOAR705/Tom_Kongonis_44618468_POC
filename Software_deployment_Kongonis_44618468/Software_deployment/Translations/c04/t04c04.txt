The Dao is empty yet you may keep drawing from it as though it could never
fill your need.

It is an abyss, like the ancestor of the world of things.

Blunt the point,
Undo the tangle,
Soften the glare,
Join the dust.

Dim, it seems almost to exist. I know not whose child it may be. It seems the
forerunner of the Lord.
