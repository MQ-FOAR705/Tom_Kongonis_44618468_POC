Heaven and earth are not kind –
Thus the ten thousand creatures become as straw dogs to
them.

The sage is not kind –

The space between heaven and earth,
How is it just like a bellows or flute?
It is empty, yet does not run out.
The more it moves, and the more it produces.

Too much talking is exceptionally exhausting,
Which is not as good as maintaining what is within.
