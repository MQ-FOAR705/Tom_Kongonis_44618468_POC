Heaven and earth are not ren: they treat the things of the world as straw
dogs. The sage is not ren: he treats the people as straw dogs.

All between heaven and earth is like a great bellows--
Empty, yet it does not collapse,
The more it is moved the more it issues forth.

Many words are soon exhausted;
Better to preserve the central.
