All in the world deem the beautiful to be beautiful; it is ugly. All deem the
good to be good; it is bad.

What is and what is not give birth to one another,
What is difficult and what is easy complete one another,
Long and short complement one another,
High and low incline towards one another,
Note and noise harmonize with one another,
Before and after follow one another.

Therefore the sage dwells in the midst of non-action (wuwei) and practices
the wordless teaching.

Herein arise the things of the world, it does not turn from them; what it gives
birth to it does not possess; what it does it does not retain. The
achievements complete, it makes no claim to them. Because it makes
no claim to them, they never leave it.
