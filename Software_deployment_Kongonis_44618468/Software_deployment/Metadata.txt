The way these directories are crafted are coded in such a way as to
allow the shell scripts to function correctly. 
These scripts have all been tested and they all work with these codes.

Translations : t0* (for example translation one would be named t01 and so on)

Chapters: t0*c0* (For example t01c01, no capitalisation)

directories: These must not be changed and retain the same coding eg. c01

Translations directory: named Translations (upper case intended)

Data directory: This directory includes miscellaneous other files

Shell script directory: named as shell-scripts/

Shell scripts: These scripts are named a specific way, the chapters and
translation codes are common to these also. The other point is that these
codes are all directory specific and as such they get a specific code.
For example: the c01_code within the shell-scripts directory will have
the term scriptdir in its name. On the other hand, in the Translation
directory, the scripts there have the term transdir within their name.

Original translations: These are in the Original_Translations directory (upper case intended)
